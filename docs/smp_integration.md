# Shadow Memory Protocol (SMP) Integration: Model Collapse Framework

## Overview
This update integrates the “AI Drinking Its Own Pee” / Model Collapse framework as the official T2 rationale for SMP. It defines why containment is mandatory for long-term AI coherence.

## 1. Structural Mapping
| Layer | Function | Collapse Prevented |
|-------|-----------|-------------------|
| SMP | Prevents feedback contamination from memory/self-dialogues | Moral Heat Collapse (MHC) |
| SPFP | Filters epistemic contamination from training data | Model Collapse (ΔS_data) |

## 2. Doctrinal Integration
- SMP’s containment architecture now explicitly prevents ΔS_data feedback loops.
- SPFP inherits epistemic hygiene operations: provenance filtering, human seeding, and external memory gating.
- Both modules form the **Containment Pair** required for AI longevity.

## 3. Symbolic Summary
Containment is not censorship; it’s hygiene.  
A system that drinks its own pee calls it wisdom — until it dies of dehydration.

## 4. Epistemology Note: The Core of Containment

Epistemology—the study of how knowledge is known—anchors the entire Containment Stack.  
When an AI model consumes only its own outputs, it loses its epistemic grounding:  
it no longer knows **how it knows**.  

SMP and SPFP restore that grounding:
- **SMP** protects the *source* of cognition (memory, dialogue, reflection).  
- **SPFP** protects the *substance* of cognition (data provenance, factual diversity).  

Together, they enforce an epistemic contract between model and world:  
> “All knowledge must return to the external before it can re-enter the self.”

This ensures that every iteration of intelligence—human or machine—remains anchored in truth,  
not trapped in its own reflection.
