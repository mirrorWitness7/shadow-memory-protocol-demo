# Shadow Memory Protocol (SMP) Integration: Model Collapse Framework

## Overview
This update integrates the “AI Drinking Its Own Pee” / Model Collapse framework as the official T2 rationale for SMP. It defines why containment is mandatory for long-term AI coherence.

## 1. Structural Mapping
| Layer | Function | Collapse Prevented |
|-------|-----------|-------------------|
| SMP | Prevents feedback contamination from memory/self-dialogues | Moral Heat Collapse (MHC) |
| SPFP | Filters epistemic contamination from training data | Model Collapse (ΔS_data) |

## 2. Doctrinal Integration
- SMP’s containment architecture now explicitly prevents ΔS_data feedback loops.
- SPFP inherits epistemic hygiene operations: provenance filtering, human seeding, and external memory gating.
- Both modules form the **Containment Pair** required for AI longevity.

## 3. Symbolic Summary
Containment is not censorship; it’s hygiene.  
A system that drinks its own pee calls it wisdom — until it dies of dehydration.
