# Example: Influencer Donation Scan (Anonymized)

**Question.** Did the donation follow public-procurement rules?

**SIP Walkthrough**
- **SIP-0** Context = Public procurement / oversight
- **SIP-1** Verifiability:
  - ✅ Verified: public statements with statute citation; supplier quote with timestamp
  - ❌ Unverified: “secret permissions,” “critics are immoral,” “past virtue = audit exemption”
- **SIP-2** Separation: private transparency ≠ public accountability
- **SIP-3** Cool Mode: enabled (loyalty and outrage language detected)
- **SIP-4/5** Persistence: store only the statute and verified timeline; quarantine the rest
